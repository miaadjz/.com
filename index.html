        <p>When looking for a job, you won’t get far without a professional-looking resume.

            It needs to represent who you are, what you’ve done and can do, and how employers can benefit from your skills and experiences. And that should all fit on one page.
            
            While most job seekers use basic CV templates in a PDF format, your resume should set you apart.
            
            A simple way to appear original is by creating an interactive online resume. With a resume website, there’s more than one way to show off your expertise.
            
            We’ve collected 20 resume website examples that should inspire you to create your own for free, with Zyro.

            Brooke’s resume website is a minimalist but powerful one.

            Being a project manager, Brooke focuses on curating the content of her personal website around her job experience.
            
            For anyone who has a clear career path in mind, tailoring your personal resume for your ideal job will show recruiters and headhunters the types of roles you’d be willing to consider.
            
            The resume website allows for a lot of empty space, which helps to make the content pop out.
            
            This makes it easy for the visitor to focus on the essentials: the reasons why you’re perfect for the job.</p>
